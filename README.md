# CleaningData_Project
This repo is created to submit the project work for the course getting and cleaning data.


There is a single script in the repo which takes the data from the data link and stores it in the root working directory of the R enviroment. The script performs all data manipulation steps  to summarize the data and finally writes it back to a txt file.
